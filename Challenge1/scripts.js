// const user = 'John'


// /* This is the lastname of the user /* const surname = 'Smith'


// console.log(user; surname;) 

// // change /* and put variable flush against comment to make sure comment refers to specific variable 
// // remove semi colons in console.log, only a comma is needed to separate
